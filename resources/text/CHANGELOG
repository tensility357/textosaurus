0.9.13
------
Added:
* Brand new sidebar "Character Map" which offers traditional character map functionality.
  Note that this character map offers ALL Unicode characters, not just first plane.
  It is also searchable.
* Text search function can now wrap around.
* External tools now can just insert or replace selected text with their output.
* Fix *.lnk file handling on Windows. If user opens *.lnk pointing to file, then the
  target file is opened. Also, handling of linked folders is fixed with Qt's native
  open file dialog.
* New PHP-only lexer.

Changed:
* Added some more substyles for some lexers, updated substyles of
  built-in color schemes.
* "Markdown Preview" now uses md4c library (https://github.com/mity/md4c) which is more up-to-date.
* HTML lexer now handles HTML5 keywords.
* Scintilla is now directly incorporated into the source tree
  and its version is updated to 4.2.2.
* Persistent DateTime format setting for external tool. Setting is now changeable in
  "Settings" -> "Editor".
* DateTime tools now follow SYSTEM locale specifics.
* Some translations added or synced.
* Prebuilt Windows binaries now use update Qt library.

Fixed:

0.9.12
------
Added:
* Ukrainian translation, thanks to "prolinuxua".
* Chinese translation, thanks to "zarchwegiant".
* Automagic file type recognition via utility `file`. This recognition is ran before file "suffix" detection and is able to correctly detect file type of many files. For example if you have Bash script with name "script" (no suffix), then this method will correctly detect it as Bash document and will fire up correct syntax highlighting etc. This method works in a x-platform way on all platforms where `file` utility is available via `PATH` env. variable.
* Automagic file type recognition is also ran when file is "reloaded from disk" and when file is "saved as" via the dialog.
* Added couple of new command line switches, namely "-c" (select another user data directory) and "-n" (force new instance launch). See `textosaurus -h` for more info.

Changed:
* Caret is explicitly set to position 0 when document is loaded.
* Scintilla core updated to latest stable (4.1.4).
* Fixed Bash lexer folding ability.
* Some code cleanups.

Fixed:
* C++17 compilation with MSVC17 fixed.
* FS sidebar combobox with drives/mountpoints now works better with network drives on Windows (note that some bugs are unsolvable and need to be probably solved upstream, for example SSHFS network drives sometimes do not work with combobox correctly).
* Show tab with correct document when asking for save.

Special thanks:
* "paoloschi" - for some good new features proposals.

0.9.11
------
Changed:
* File encryption now uses OpenSSL utility and the encryption is exactly the same as produced by running "openssl enc...", so now you can {en,de}crypt your file either with Textosaurus or with "openssl" CLI tool.
* Bundled OpenSSL on Windows was updated to latest 1.1.1a version and this updated library is also used by bundled Qt libs as well.

Fixed:
* No errors were reported while saving to write-protected file.


0.9.10
------
Added:

0.9.7
-----
Added:
* Code folding (see menu "View" -> "Code Folding"):
    * supports many languages/lexers,

0.9.5
-----
Textosaurus application is now split into main executable (textosaurus) and core library (libtextosaurus). This is needed to allow for robust plugin architecture. That said, it is no longer possible to publish statically built Textosaurus (single executable file). Textosaurus will support plugins (C++/Qt, dll/so/dylib files, loaded at runtime, simple API) in the future. The work on plugin API is already underway.

Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable must be installed. It is bundled in Textosaurus installer and is copied into Textosaurus folder. You have to install it from there if needed.

Added:
* Macros sidebar which allows to record, play and save macros.
* Experimental Mac OS X build. There was some effor to make good DMG bundles but I failed. Therefore "app dir" is generated instead and Textosaurus core library is placed in the same folder as main Textosaurus executable.

Changed:
* Application is now split into two modules (executable + core library).
* When closing app with some modified documents, then application asks for all "Save/Discard" confirmations first and exits only when everything is confimed by the user.

0.9.4
-----
Added:
* Show main window (instead of hiding it to tray area) when minimized and tray icon is clicked.

Changed:

    * Shows all mountpoints on Linux.
    * Fixed couple of random bugs when some folder could not be entered.

* Fixed build on ARM platform.

0.9.3
-----
Added:
* AWK lexer. (#33)
* LCD-optimized fonts on Windows.

* Using hoextdown instead of hoedown for Markdown preview.
* Scintilla component updated to latest master (4.0.4).

Fixed:
* Some smaller FS sidebar-related fixes.

0.9.0
-----
Added:
* Tray icon support. (#13)
* Main window can stay on top. (#31)

Changed:
* File save dialog does not append ".txt".
* Switched to semantic versioning. Versioning now uses MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme, which means:
    * MAJOR number is changed if major breaking feature is added,
    * MINOR number is changed if less important feature is added,
    * PATCH number is changed when bugs are fixed and tiny new features are added.
* Code refactoring.

This release marks big milestone in development of Textosaurus. At this point, all features I need from text editor, are implemented. In upcoming releases, there will be primarily performance enhancements, GUI polishments and bug fixes.

Added:
* Experimental support for color schemes. Color schemes offer these features:
    * all custom schemes saved in single .ini file with simple format,
